## Software Architecture ‚Äì Layered Architecture

The Main Database that we‚Äôve used for our project is MYSQL. We use the Laravel PHP framework which facilitates robust web application development with built-in tools for database and a few templates. We mainly focused on User Authentication, creating a secure payment portal, creating a user-friendly UI for ordering online, and sending email notifications to users.

## CICD Pipeline
### CI
The CI Pipeline runs automatically during every pull request. The migrations and tests run, and the output indicates whether they were successful or unsuccessful.

### CD
Link your Heroku app to a GitHub repo in the Heroku dashboard under the Deploy tab, select the branch you want to deploy from (master), and enable Automatic Deploys, so each push to the branch triggers a deployment.
These are the steps used for continuous deployment using Heruko once the code gets updated the pipeline gets triggered.

## DevOps Metrics Trends Chart:

 1. **Deployment Frequency:** A deployment rate of one deployment each week (There was a deployment of defects during the previous week), demonstrating our dedication to being agile and responsive in promptly addressing stakeholder feedback.
 2. **Percentage of Failed Deployments:** Of the 5 deployments within the month, none failed, leading to a failure rate of 0. This underscores the success of our testing methodologies and deployment automation, even on a smaller scale.
3. **Lead Time from Development to Deployment:** The typical time taken from integrating code changes to their deployment on our development server is 15 minutes, demonstrating our capability to advance changes through the deployment pipeline quickly.
4. **Change Volume:** In the last month, our team has recorded an average of 35 commits and 20 pull requests on GitHub, demonstrating steady development engagement and teamwork among members.
5. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** In case of an incident, our team can restore service in about 17 minutes, reducing any interruptions to the project development and guaranteeing a prompt resolution of any issues.
