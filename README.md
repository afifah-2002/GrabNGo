Product Vision:
FOR students and teachers WHO want a hassle-free way to order meals and skip long cafeteria lines, THE GrabNGo system is an innovative cafeteria management platform THAT enables users to browse menus, customize orders, and schedule pickup times with ease, ensuring their meals are freshly prepared and ready upon arrival. UNLIKE UberEats or similar third-party delivery services, GrabNGo focuses on maximizing convenience and minimizing wait times by allowing users to place, modify, or cancel orders through a user-friendly online interface and receive instant notifications when their food is ready. OUR solution optimizes meal pickup, reduces crowding, and enhances the overall dining experience for a busy academic environment.
